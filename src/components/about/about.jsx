          <p>Welcome to my profile,
            <br /> 
            <br />Previously a Research Analyst with 2+ years of experience working on projects from wide range of industries some of which are technology, retail and social sciences.  
            </p>

            <p>During my time as a research analyst I got the opportunity to analyze our client's websites and derive insights to improve their customers web experience. This compelled me to learn about web-development technologies to understand the Why?, How? and What? of web development. This was enough to lead me onto a self-taught journey into the world of Front-end web development. </p>

            <p>My journey of becoming a self-taught Front-end developer has been extremely rewarding and wouldn't have been possible without the amazing resources available in the web-dev community.</p>
            
            <p>What began as a task in my job, has become a fully blown passion into creating elegant, accessible, secure and customer centric websites. </p>
